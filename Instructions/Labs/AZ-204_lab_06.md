# Lab 06: Authenticating by using OpenID Connect, MSAL and .NET SDKs

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community brings needed changes to our attention; however, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Sign in to the lab virtual machine

Sign in to your Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) by using the following credentials:
    
-   Username: **Admin**

-   Password: **Pa55w.rd**

> **Note**: Instructions to connect to the virtual lab environment will be provided by your instructor.

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab:
    
-   Microsoft Edge

-   Visual Studio Code

### Exercise 1: Configure a single-tenant Azure AD environment

#### Task 1: Open the Azure portal

1.  On the taskbar, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

1.  In the open browser window, browse to the Azure portal ([portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)) and sign in with the account you will be using for this lab.

    > **Note**: If this is your first time signing in to the Azure portal, you will be offered a tour of the portal. Select **Get Started** to skip the tour and begin using the portal.

#### Task 2: Register an application in Azure AD

1.  In the Azure portal, use the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the page to search for **Azure Active Directory** and, in the list of results, select **Azure Active Directory**.

    > **Note**: This redirects your browser session to the blade of the Azure AD tenant associated with your Azure subscription.

1.  On the **Azure Active Directory** blade, select **App registrations** in the **Manage** section.

1.  In the **App registrations** section, select **+ New registration**.

1.  In the **Register an application** section, perform the following actions, and then select **Register**:

#### Task 5: Create an Azure AD user

1.  In the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new PowerShell session. If Cloud Shell defaults to a Bash session, select **Bash** and, in the drop down menu, select **PowerShell**.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than sign (\>) and underscore character (\_).

    > **Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell**, when prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. When you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and then select **Create storage**.

1.  From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following command to sign in to the Azure AD tenant associated with your Azure subscription:

      ```powershell
       Connect-AzureAD
      ```

1.  Run the following command to retrieve and display the primary DNS domain name of the Azure AD tenant:

       ```powershell
       $aadDomainName = ((Get-AzureAdTenantDetail).VerifiedDomains)[0].Name
       $aadDomainName
       ```

1.  Record the value of the DNS domain name. You'll use this value later in the lab.

1.  Run the following commands to create Azure AD users that you will use to test Azure AD authentication:

       ```powershell
       $passwordProfile = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.PasswordProfile
       $passwordProfile.Password = 'Pa55w.rd1234'
       $passwordProfile.ForceChangePasswordNextLogin = $false
       New-AzureADUser -AccountEnabled $true -DisplayName 'aadlabuser1' -PasswordProfile $passwordProfile -MailNickName 'aadlabuser1' -UserPrincipalName "aadlabuser1@$aadDomainName"
       ```

1.  Run the following command to identify the user principal name of the newly created Azure AD user:

       ```powershell
       (Get-AzureADUser -Filter "MailNickName eq 'aadlabuser1'").UserPrincipalName
       ```

    > **Note**: Record the user principal name. You'll use this value later in the lab. <!--Marcin, should line 134 also be a note? It is a very similar statement.-->

1.  Close the Cloud Shell pane.

#### Review

In this exercise, you registered a single-tenant Azure AD application and created an Azure AD user account.

### Exercise 2: Create a single-tenant ASP.NET Core web app

#### Task 1: Create an ASP.NET Core web app project

1.  On the lab computer, start **Command Prompt**.

1.  From the command prompt, run the following commands to create and set the working directory to **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\06\\Starter\\OIDCClientST** and create a new .NET Core web app based on the MVC template (replace the placeholders `<application_ID>`, `<tenant_ID>`, and `<domain_Name>` with the corresponding values you recorded earlier in this lab): <!--Marcin, this instruction has the potential of being verbose and confusing. It is too long a sentence. Can we instead simplify this step to just say "From the command prompt, run the following commands to create and set the working directory and to create a new .NET Core web app based on the MVC template. And we can move the details to comments within the code block? Such as move the comments "create and set the working directory to **Allfiles (F):\\Allfiles\\Labs\\06\\Starter\\OIDCClientST**" before the md command in teh code, and the replaceing values details to come before the "dotnet" command. Would that work? Can we also expand MVC at the first instance?-->

    ```
    F:
    md "F:\Allfiles\Labs\06\Starter\OIDCClient" 2> NUL
    cd F:\Allfiles\Labs\06\Starter\OIDCClient
    dotnet new mvc --auth SingleOrg --client-id <application_ID> --tenant-id <tenant_ID> --domain <domain_Name>
    rmdir .\obj /S /Q
    ```

1.  On the lab computer, start Visual Studio Code.

1.  In the **File** menu, select **Open Folder**.

    | Section         | Property           | Value                                                   |
    | --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **iisSettings** | **sslPort**        | **44321**                                               |
    | **OIDCClient**  | **applicationUrl** | **https://localhost:44321** |
    

    > **Note**: The port numbers must match the value you specified when creating the Azure AD app registration.

1.  Save and close the file.

1.  In the Visual Studio Code Explorer pane, select **OIDCClient.csproj**.

1.  Ensure that the value of `<TargetFramework>` element is set to **netcoreapp3.1**.

1.  Close the file without making any changes.

1.  In the Visual Studio Code Explorer pane, select **Startup.cs**.
    <!-- Marcin, I am not sure if it will work but the next few instructions are all about deleting existing lines of code and replacing them with alternate code. Can we combine them all into a table? Left column showing the lines to be removed and right column showing the new lines to replace them with? It might reduce the number of steps.-->

1.  Remove the `using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.AzureAD.UI;` directive.

1.  Add the following **using** directives directly after the entry that you removed in the previous step:

    ```
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect;
    using Microsoft.Identity.Web;
    using Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI;
    ```

1.  Remove the following lines:

    ```
            services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                .AddAzureAD(options => Configuration.Bind("AzureAd", options));
    ```

1.  Replace the lines you removed in the last step with the following ones:

    ```
            services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
                .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));
    ```

1.  Remove the following line:

    ```
            services.AddRazorPages();
